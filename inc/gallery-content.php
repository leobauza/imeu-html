  <p>"There is such a large pool of Palestinian talent at every level, the goal was to encourage Palestinians to invest in their own people in this industry, and in jobs," recalls Zuaiter, adding, "It was actually pure coincidence that the film was 95% Palestinian funded, we needed to supplement an investment that fell through and we got the opportunity to bring more Palestinians to join the bigger dream. I am extremely proud."</p>
  <p>A story of two lovers on opposite sides of Israel's separation wall, Omar seeks to humanize rather than demonize the characters. "There's nothing definitive in the film -- good and bad or right and wrong. There are shades of gray. This is what makes the film universal. Complex personalities," explains Zuaiter.</p>
  <p>The film explores universal themes that set the stage for its complex characters and unexpected storyline. "Three themes really compel any story – every great piece of art explores in some way universal concepts of power, love and violence."</p>
  <p>Trying to produce a film in Palestine provided its share of challenges. "Filming in Palestine, there was less to fall back on," says Zuaiter of the experience. "We were using investors' hard earned money and wanted to make something that people would be proud of. The crews didn't always have all the resources Israeli film crews have – the film infrastructure isn't the same in Palestine as it is in Israel. This production was an example of Palestinian cinema taken to a new level."</p>
